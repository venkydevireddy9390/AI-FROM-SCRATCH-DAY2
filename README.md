# NumPy Arithmetic & Statistical Operations

This repository contains my **NumPy assignment** demonstrating basic **array creation**, **arithmetic operations**, and **statistical operations** using Python's NumPy library.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this assignment is to understand how NumPy arrays work and how to perform common mathematical and statistical operations efficiently.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **NumPy**
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📂 Assignment Overview

### 1️⃣ Array Creation

* Creation of **1D, 2D, and 3D NumPy arrays**
* Understanding how data is stored in different dimensions

Example:

* 1D Array: `[1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 9]`
* 2D Array: Matrix-style arrays (rows & columns)
* 3D Array: Arrays of matrices

### 2️⃣ Array Properties

The following NumPy array attributes are explored:

* **shape** – Structure of the array
* **size** – Total number of elements
* **ndim** – Number of dimensions

These properties help in understanding array structure and memory layout.

### 3️⃣ Slicing & Indexing

* Slicing elements from **1D arrays**
* Row and column slicing in **2D arrays**
* Accessing elements in **3D arrays**

This demonstrates efficient data extraction using NumPy indexing.

### 4️⃣ Broadcasting

* Performing operations between arrays of different shapes
* Understanding NumPy broadcasting rules
* Applying scalar and array-based operations efficiently

### 5️⃣ Arithmetic Operations

The following arithmetic operations are performed on NumPy arrays:

* ➕ Addition (adding a constant to each element)
* ➖ Subtraction
* ✖️ Multiplication
* ➗ Division

These operations highlight NumPy’s **vectorized computation** capability.

### 6️⃣ Statistical Operations

Basic statistical calculations are performed, including:

* Mean
* Median
* Minimum
* Maximum
* Sum

## ✅ Key Learnings

* Understanding NumPy array creation
* Performing element-wise arithmetic operations
* Applying statistical functions on arrays
* Gaining hands-on experience with NumPy syntax

## 📸 Output

Each operation displays the resulting NumPy array directly in the notebook for better understanding.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells sequentially
